            <p class="card-text">Monkey D. Luffy is the primary protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven,
                he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure,
                the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit, which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril
                causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.
                Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there,
                he becomes a sworn brother with Ace, Garp's other ward, and Sabo, alocal runaway noble.</p>
